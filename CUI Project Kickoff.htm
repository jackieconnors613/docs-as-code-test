        <h1>CUI Kickoff</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Review and amend the sample project plan delivered with the CUI Template Pack. The sample project plan identifies the typical phases you must execute to deliver a successful CUI project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gather the CUI Project team together for a kick-off. We advise having the following members:</p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Project Manager</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Executive CUI sponsor</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Legal or governance representative</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>IT Manager</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>End-user representative</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <p>Provide the CUI project team with the “CUI&#160;For Project Teams” document supplied with the CUI Template Pack. This document gives a good overview of the reasons behind CUI.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review the CUI template file that is delivered with the CUI Template Pack and make relevant changes. Refer to the CUI Template Reference Guide for CUIConfig-V100 delivered with the CUI Template Pack. Import the TCF&#160;file and review the Schema and Policy values and settings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Consult the IT requirements to start the purchase and configuration processes. The sample project plan identifies the IT pre-requisites needed to run a successful CUI project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the test group. Feedback from end-users is essential. This group will help you formulate a better policy configuration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Start the communication plan to executives, the project team, and end-users. A successful CUI project must be transparent in its objectives.  A thorough communication plan can help with this. Refer to the sample end-user training material delivered with the CUI Template Pack as examples.</p>
            </li>
