        <h1>About CUI</h1>
        <p>Established by Executive Order 13556, the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) program standardizes the way the Executive branch handles unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Government-wide policies.<MadCap:footnote style="mc-footnote-position: page;"><a href="https://www.archives.gov/cui">https://www.archives.gov/cui</a></MadCap:footnote></p>
        <p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) serves as the Executive Agent to implement this order and oversees agency actions to ensure compliance with the order.</p>
        <p>CUI establishes policy for agencies with respect to “designating, safeguarding, disseminating, marking, decontrolling, and disposing of CUI”.</p>
        <h2>CUI Content</h2>
        <p>All CUI content is either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Basic – does not require specific protections</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Specified – requires specific protections, such as visual markings, and limits on who can access the information</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are some considerations when writing and sending documents and messages containing CUI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you are using visual markings, they  MUST appear on the top portion of the page. When sending an email, a marking MUST appear at the top portion of the email.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All documents containing CUI MUST indicate the agency of designation, for example, “Controlled by: The Department of …”.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dissemination controls are identified with an additional markings, for example, “NOFORN” for No Foreign Nationals.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
